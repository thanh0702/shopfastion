# Cart Quantity and Total Update Fix

## Tasks Completed
- [x] Modified `updateCart` method in `HomeController.php` to return updated item_total and cart_total in JSON response
- [x] Updated JavaScript in `cart.blade.php` to use totals from backend response instead of recalculating in frontend
- [x] Added error handling in JavaScript fetch call to alert user on failures
- [x] Removed debugging console.log statements that were causing syntax errors
- [x] Fixed cart.blade.php file with clean JavaScript code

## Testing Status
No testing has been performed yet since I cannot run the application directly. The critical aspects that need verification are:

1. **JavaScript syntax errors**: Ensure no more "Uncaught SyntaxError" messages in browser console
2. **Quantity buttons functionality**: Clicking + and - buttons should update the quantity input and trigger backend update
3. **Item total updates**: The individual item total should update correctly when quantity changes
4. **Cart total updates**: The overall cart total should update correctly reflecting all items
5. **Error handling**: Invalid requests should show user alerts instead of silent failures
6. **User authentication**: Ensure the user is logged in when testing cart functionality

## Next Steps
- Test the cart page functionality
- Check browser console for any errors
- Verify that quantity changes update totals correctly
- Confirm CSRF token is working properly
